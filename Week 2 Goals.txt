Week 2 Reflection:

My week 2 goals were to improve my D3 skills. Throughout the week, I made two bar charts of different types. The first was a pretty standard chart that utilized some of the fundamental aspects of a graph with D3. After I had created this, I wanted to make something unique and cool that I wouldn't be able to in seaborn, so I created a hierarchical bar chart that was interactive! I was very happy with my second chart, and it met my expectations of skills modifying and creating D3 graphs. I felt like I struggled with a lot of the same things as last week though, in terms of finding motivation to go the extra mile for my graphs or website. Even though I had a product that I was happy with and thought was a complex utilization of D3 skills, I still felt a little bit unsuccessful because of this.

Week 3 Goals:

For week 3, rather than simply saying I'm going to fix my procrastination issues, I'm going to aim to do a couple specific things to make improvements. Firstly, I'm going to be switching my dataset, so that I feel like I'm not repeating the same graphs. I had already made some graphs for my previous dataset in seaborn, and working with the same dataset was feeling stale. By switching data, I will introduce more novelty into my work and no longer have the excuse that I'm bored with the data. I also would like to allocate more time for working on my tasks by showing up to class earlier, since I am usually awake anyways.
	For results I want to see from my final project, I'm more interested in HTML and CSS, and how I can make a cool encoding by focusing more on webpage design. What we talked about today about styling pre-existing HTML elements sounded really interesting to me, and is something that I think I will definitely be aiming to incorporate in my final project. Right now, I'm thinking of trying to create one big connected visualization, whose representation I can change through a HTML radio selection element. While I think this will be difficult to create, I want to spend most of my time creating my own style.css file to make my webpage look very professional, so that I can cement when I learned in the first week.
